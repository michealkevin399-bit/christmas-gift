    <h1>Merry Christmas 🎄</h1>
    <p>
      Even though we’re miles apart this Christmas, you’re the first thing on my mind today. This little space is just for you—a small way to show you how much you mean to me until I can celebrate by your side. As this is our first Christmas in this relationship, I really wanted to gift you something special, but as the hamster plan failed, I’ve created this website for you to make this Christmas a little bit special. I'm waiting for the time when we can celebrate Christmas together; until then, I’ll show my love in any way I can. Merry Christmas, and I love you to infinity.
